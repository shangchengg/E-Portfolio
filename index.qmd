Hello People!

This is my E-Portfolio landing page. My name is Brian Li, a current MGEM student at UBC. I was born and raised in China, and studied biology and urban forestry for my bachelor's degree. I found geo-spatial analysis is pretty fun and we enjoy the time playing with data. Here are links to my professional social media (linkedin, X/Twitter, etc).

Contact me if you have the same interest or looking for any help.
